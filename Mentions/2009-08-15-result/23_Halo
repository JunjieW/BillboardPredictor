@forgetfool Well fun is a subjective word. But KZ2 is overshadows the quality of Halo 3 in all aspects.
...does anyone knowv when the next Halo is coming out? I need to prepare for my impending death.
@Doom_CMYK Halo wins with controls, gameplay, 4-player co-op, and multiplayer. There's a reason it's the best selling exclusive title.
WHAT?! A Fable Movie??? Isn't Mass Effect, Gears of War, Halo: Fall of Reach, Bioshock, and Metal Gear enough???!!!
I didn't know that Steven Speilberg was going to direct the Halo movie... it might actually turn out pretty good.
Daniel thinks that District 9 is the Halo movie.
Microsoft not quite moving forward with that 'Halo' movie just yet, contrary to recent rumors. - http://bit.ly/Ez4jI
@forgetfool I guess Wii Fit absolutely dominates quality over Halo 3 since it's selling a lot.

District 9 was awesome. Fox & Universal look mega foolish for killing Halo, cause Neil Blomkamp would've shot the shit out of that movie
played Portal: Still Alive (XBLA), Halo 3 (360), UNO (XBLA), and 1 other game in the last 24 hours. http://raptr.com/joshsieg
played Halo 3 (360), Fallout 3 (360), and 'Splosion Man (XBLA) in the last 24 hours. http://raptr.com/Rizyq
District 9 (movie) = surprisingly good, though it's sad to see all that hardware Jackson had made for the "Halo" project that feel through.
District 9 was kick ass! It's a shame that whole deal with the Halo movie and special fx whiz Neill Blomkamp couldn't get it worked out...

District 9. See it. You won't be disappointed. Complex, thought-provoking, wonderfully made film. And they say he can't handle Halo. psh.
Damn, District 9 was a great movie but the shaky cam did make me a little sick. I liked how they referenced Halo at the end.

@bethatasitmay re: sequel. Truthfully, no. But it would be fun to see the prawns come to earth guns blazing. In effect, a not-Halo Halo.
