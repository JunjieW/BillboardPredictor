Finally watched Sideways that I had from Netflix for a few weeks now. I actually really enjoyed it.
@drive_blind No. Go fuck yourself. Sideways. With a bargepole. That has barbs. And has been rubbed with chili powder.

Wow. this new, "Battle Damaged" Sideways looks nice. a bit more movie accurate. and the battle damage doesnt get in the way of it like jazz.
Watching "Sideways" (again). Arguably the greatest film ever made. Pinot Noir, friendship, midlife crisis. What else do you need?
