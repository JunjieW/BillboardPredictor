Cool...I didn't know that Kesha (from Right Round) has also played in "I Kissed A Girl" and wrote a song with The Veronicas....pretty cool!
Flo Rida/Kesha's "Right Round" cover is a butchery of a S.A.W. classic. OTOH it's good that the legend lives on a quarter century later.

@armak28 Flo Rida is probably the worst rapper I've heard. I can't understand a word he says in "Right Round."
Obsessed with Flo Rider now lol.I love Right Round :)
