District 9 was brilliant! If Halo is ever made into a movie I vote Neill Blomkamp. At this point I think he's the only one to pull it off.
@MontyPrime I haven't played Halo or Halo 2. *shrug*

Guess I can switch away from the Angels-O's now... Halos with 5 R and still going in 13th. On to SD-STL.
Halo is a great franchise, but I wish bungie would bring back the Myth series. Myth II Soulblighter was hands down my fav game of all time.
Wow. Golf and Extra Innings. At least the Halos are gonna pull this off. #angels

@roxbrasil http://twitpic.com/ecodg - Tá dificil mesmo, pode ser Bioshock 2, Halo ODSt(até mesmo reach), Forza 3 ou Beatles RB.
If I can pick up Assassin's Creed for 20, then I should be able to get Halo 3 for 20 as well.
I've read a lot of "Avatar looks like Halo omg" and I don't see it at all.
@Chufmoney Yeah, I'd say much more Aliens than Halo
@scalenine Me too. Flex Halo buttons and scrollbars are the worst, especially when the rest of the app is skinned.
the vocals are sick in Halo.
There's a strange woman listening to "Halo" and singing along in the room next to me. Who let her in my house?
PLEASE FOLLOW MY BLOG AND HELP ME! I'm looking at http://bit.ly/St0jM "BaileysHalo"
@jamielucinda Halo is cute and already on my list. Need some ideas other than that, though! RE is toooo scary for me to play alone/at night!
@BikerScout Looks like what Halo: the movie was supposed to be.

@DorkmanScott I certainly don't think of giant mechs with giant guns when I think Halo
@HaloWaypoint I got in trouble for buying Legendary Halo3. Mjolnir helmet display box still residing under stairs as nowhere to put out :-(
Listening to the Halo 2 soundtrack. I remember being insanely hyped for this game.

Just pre-ordered Halo: Reach. I will get a BETA key for it as I pre-ordered Halo 3: ODST but Reach looks very interesting.
How does it make any sense that Mario and Sonic Olympics is worth 5 dollars more trade-in value than Halo 3. I mean, really?
Also just got off the phone with @pizzolo from Halo 8 about our press release plans for IASS and TNE. Can't wait!
