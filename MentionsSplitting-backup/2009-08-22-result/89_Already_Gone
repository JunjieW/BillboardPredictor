Already Gone - Kelly Clarkson, Nocturnal By The Moon & Quiet Desperation - Adam Lambert. I swear off these songs for the night.
Ever listen to Beyonce's Halo and Kelly Clarkson's Already Gone? The music is the same. Whos got the better song? I vote Kelly Clarkson.
You know, I really didn't think so at first but the more I listen to it, Kelly Clarkson's 'Already Gone' does sound like Beyonce's 'Halo.'

@Cassaskii Already Gone was written and recorded prior to Halo. Ryan Tedder co-wrote both, and used the same track. Look it up.
I dislike Kelly Clarkson with great passion. But.. if 'Already Gone' appeared on the New Moon soundtrack, I'd be fine with that.
