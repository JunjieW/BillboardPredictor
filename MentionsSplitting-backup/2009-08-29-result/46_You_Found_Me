@angelaadelacruz That is a great song btw! (The Fray- You Found Me)
Why is it that everytime I pass that bus-stop "You Found Me" would be playing on the radio. Lol..
In love with @TheFray's "You Found Me" all over again. I can't believe someone covered "Cable Car" in a cheerful rendition. =_="
@linds2815 yesterday, I heard You Found Me on the radio and I flipped a shit 'cause I thought it was Matt but it was the Fray :( disappoint.
Cellcast is making my computer slow as heeeeeeeeelll, and it was just frozen. Ugh. Anyways, I LOVE You Found Me!

"You Found Me" by The Fray is one of those songs that just won't die. It keeps getting used in trailers for shitty RomComs.
♫ You Found Me ♫ by The Fray is a great song. Hear it for yourself: http://bit.ly/MYuAn
The Fray for me. Cause @MGiraudOfficial now owns "You Found Me" and @KrisAllen4Real has owned "Heartless" since he first sang it.
@mgiraudOfficial hope you had a great night tonight in Michigan. Your version of You Found Me is better than the original :)
