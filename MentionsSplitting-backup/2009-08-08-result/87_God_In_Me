Malice of the Clipse jumped on Mary Mary's "God In Me" record was already tough but Malice shocked me!
If the beat for Mary Mary's "God In Me" was given to a rapper or secular singer, it'd be getting remixed like this http://bit.ly/13NT6w
@jozenc if "The God In Me" was given to a secular artist it would be and is "Blame It"... No need for a remix there.
