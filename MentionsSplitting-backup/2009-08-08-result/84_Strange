http://bit.ly/1aaPfm via @addthis This is an article about strange holidays around the world. Very Strange
"Come and See" was a good movie. Very weird ending though! It kind of reminded me of "Strangeland" with Dee Snider. Happy Saturday!
Dr Strangelove has one of the oddest endings I've ever seen. Loved it to bits though.
